# Netflix Data Visualization Project

## Introduction

This repository contains the code and documentation for my Data Visualization final project on Netflix. The goal of the project is to analyze different metrics contributing to the monthly revenue of Netflix using data visualization techniques. The analysis focuses on key factors such as country-wise revenue, subscription types, gender, device usage, join date, and age.

## Project Structure

- **Notebooks:** Jupyter notebooks containing the code for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
- **Data:** Dataset used for the project sourced from Kaggle.
- **Visualizations:** Images of visualizations generated during the analysis.
- **Reports:** Final report and executive summary.

## Project Overview

1. **Definition:** Identify the dataset features and define the key variables for analysis.
2. **Preparation:** Clean the dataset, handle date formats, and create additional calculated fields for analysis.
3. **Analysis:** Utilize data visualizations to explore key metrics and relationships:
    - Country vs Revenue
    - Subscription type vs Revenue
    - Gender vs Revenue
    - Device type vs Monthly Revenue
    - Join Date vs Revenue
    - Age vs Revenue
4. **Deployment:** Plan for deploying the study using Tableau, including .twbx file, PDF report, and deployment to Tableau Server.

## Findings

- The majority of revenue comes from the United States and Canada.
- Basic subscription type contributes significantly more revenue compared to Premium.
- Revenue is almost equal from both genders, suggesting no bias in content production.
- Device type does not show a significant impact on revenue, but laptops and tablets have a slight edge.
- Revenue peaks in October 2022, possibly due to promotional offers.

## Dashboard

A prominent dashboard with key performance indicators (KPIs) has been created to visualize the findings.
