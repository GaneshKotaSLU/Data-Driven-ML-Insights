# Starbucks Beverages Clustering

# Overview:

This repository contains an analysis of Starbucks beverages using unsupervised learning techniques, including K-MEANS and DBSCAN, along with PCA for Dimensionality Reduction. The primary objective is to cluster different Starbucks beverages based on their calorie levels. This project aims to provide insights into the grouping of beverages, which can be valuable for both customers and Starbucks decision-makers.

# Dataset:

The dataset used in this analysis consists of information about Starbucks beverages, with a focus on calorie levels. The dataset may include details such as beverage names, ingredients, sizes, and calorie counts. The data source and details are included in the CSV file available at https://github.com/reisanar/datasets/blob/master/starbucks.csv or https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/henryshan/starbucks.

# Key Techniques Explored:

# K-MEANS Clustering:
Implementation of the K-MEANS algorithm to group beverages based on their similarity in calorie levels.

# DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise):
Utilization of DBSCAN for identifying clusters in the data based on the density of calorie levels.

# PCA (Principal Component Analysis):
Application of PCA for dimensionality reduction to visualize the clustered data in lower-dimensional space.

# Analysis Summary:

The project leverages unsupervised learning techniques to uncover patterns in Starbucks beverages' calorie levels. Both K-MEANS and DBSCAN clustering methods are explored, and the results are visualized using PCA. The goal is to provide a meaningful and interpretable grouping of beverages based on their nutritional content.
