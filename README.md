**Wish E-commerce Product Classification**

**Overview:**

This file is in relevance to the analysis and classification models for an e-commerce dataset obtained from Kaggle, specifically focusing on the Wish platform. The primary goal of this project is to classify products as either "Good" or "Bad" based on various features, providing valuable insights for decision-makers in the e-commerce domain.

**Dataset:** The dataset was collected from Kaggle, and it includes information about summer products and sales on the Wish platform. Dataset Source: Wish E-commerce Dataset on Kaggle (The URL for the source of the data set is https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jmmvutu/summer-products-and-sales-in-ecommerce-wish) Creator: Jeffrey Mvutu Mabilama

**Key Questions Explored:** 
**Product Classification Criteria:** 
   Identification of criteria to classify a product as "Good" or "Bad."

**Classification Models:** 
   Implementation and comparison of various classification algorithms: Logistic Regression Random Forest Bagging Boosting Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) Radial SVM

**Analysis Summary:**

The project employs both regression and classification techniques to understand relationships between variables and classify products. Key classification models (Random Forest, Bagging, Boosting, Linear SVM, Radial SVM, Logistic Regression) are evaluated based on accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity.

**Model Performance:** 
   **Bagging Model:** Identified as the most effective model, showcasing high accuracy (80.22%) and sensitivity (55.17%). 
   **Variable Importance:** Top contributing factors include merchant ratings, retail price, and countries shipped to.

**Future Work:** Consider additional factors for product classification, such as pricing strategies and discounts. Analyze the impact of regular prices on product classification. Feel free to explore the project and provide feedback. Happy coding!
