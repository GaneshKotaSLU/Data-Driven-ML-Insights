# Data Visualization and Analytics Repository

## Overview

This repository showcases diverse data visualizations and analytics projects, including a comprehensive analysis of Adidas shoe data and other datasets. It aims to highlight trends, patterns, and insights across various domains using tools like Power BI and Python.

## About the Dataset

## Source:

The dataset was collected from Adidas Germany website using ethical web scraping techniques. The data represents approximately 3400 unique shoe models with multiple size-availability pairs updated daily for 12 days. Some countries (e.g., Germany) have multiple days of data, while others have fewer.

## Disclaimer:

Availability Column: The dataset contains a significant number of 'max' (15) values for availability. This likely indicates Adidas' restocking process, which may occur randomly. Users are encouraged to filter out these values and optionally exclude '0' values, depending on their use case.

The data was collected during the afternoon and late-night hours.
